<h3 align="left">Introduction
  
<h4 align="left">The process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral. Understanding peopleâ€™s emotions is essential for businesses since customers are able to express their thoughts and feelings more openly than ever before. By automatically analysing customer feedback, from survey responses to social media conversations, brands are able to listen attentively to their customers, and tailor products and services to meet their needs.</h4>
